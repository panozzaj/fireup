FIREUP(1)                    User Commands                    FIREUP(1)

NAME
    fireup - local development server manager

DESCRIPTION
    fireup manages local development servers with automatic port
    allocation, subdomain routing (*.test), and a web dashboard.

    Dashboard: http://fireup.test

CONFIGURATION
    Config files are stored in ~/.config/fireup/

    SIMPLE COMMAND (recommended)
        Create a file with just a command. fireup assigns a dynamic port
        via $PORT, avoiding conflicts with other apps.

        Example: ~/.config/fireup/myapp
            rails server -p $PORT

    FIXED PORT PROXY (not recommended)
        A file containing just a port number proxies to that port.
        Fixed ports can conflict; prefer commands with $PORT.

        Example: ~/.config/fireup/legacy
            3000

    STATIC SITE (symlink)
        Symlink to a directory containing index.html.

        Example:
            ln -s ~/projects/my-site ~/.config/fireup/mysite

    YAML CONFIG
        For more options, use YAML format (appname.yml).

        Example: ~/.config/fireup/myapp.yml
            description: My Rails App
            root: ~/projects/myapp
            cmd: rails server -p $PORT -b 127.0.0.1
            env:
              RAILS_ENV: development
              DATABASE_URL: postgres://localhost/myapp_dev

    MULTI-SERVICE YAML
        For apps with multiple services (e.g., web + assets).

        Example: ~/.config/fireup/myapp.yml
            description: My Full-Stack App
            root: ~/projects/myapp
            services:
              web:
                cmd: rails server -p $PORT -b 127.0.0.1
                default: true
              assets:
                cmd: npm run dev
                env:
                  PORT: $PORT

        URLs:
          - http://myapp.test        -> web service (default)
          - http://assets-myapp.test -> assets service

YAML OPTIONS
    Root-level options:
        description   Human-readable app description
        root          Working directory (supports ~)
        cmd           Command to run (for single-service apps)
        env           Environment variables (map)
        alias         Single alias for the app
        aliases       List of aliases for the app
        static        Set to true for static file serving

    Service-level options (under services:):
        cmd           Command to run
        env           Environment variables (map)
        default       If true, this service handles the base domain
        depends_on    List of services that must start first

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
    fireup sets these variables for each process:

    PORT          The allocated port for this service. Your command should
                  listen on this port.

    FORCE_COLOR   Set to "1" to enable colored output in most tools.

    You can reference $PORT in env values:
        env:
          API_URL: http://localhost:$PORT/api

URLS AND ROUTING
    Apps are accessible at http://<appname>.test

    For multi-service apps:
        http://<appname>.test              -> default service
        http://<service>-<appname>.test    -> specific service

    Examples:
        http://blog.test                   -> blog app
        http://myapp.test                  -> myapp's default service
        http://api-myapp.test              -> myapp's api service

COMMANDS
    APP STATUS
        fireup status          List apps and their running status
        fireup status myapp    Filter to apps/services matching "myapp"
        fireup status --json   Output as JSON (same as /api/status)
        fireup list            Alias for 'status'

SERVICE NAME FORMATS
    For start/stop/restart, you can target individual services:

    myapp                 All services in the app
    myapp:worker          The 'worker' service (colon syntax)
    worker.myapp          The 'worker' service (dot syntax)
    worker                The service if name is unique across apps

VIEWING LOGS
    Server logs (request routing):
        fireup logs

    App logs:
        fireup logs myapp

    Follow logs in real-time:
        fireup logs -f myapp

    Show last N lines:
        fireup logs -n 50 myapp

    Logs are also visible in the dashboard at http://fireup.test

TROUBLESHOOTING
    "Address already in use"
        Another process is using the port. fireup allocates ports in the
        50000-60000 range. Check for orphaned processes:
            lsof -i :50000-60000 | grep LISTEN

    App won't start
        1. Check the app's logs: fireup logs <app>
        2. Verify the command works manually:
               cd /path/to/app && PORT=3000 <your-command>
        3. Ensure dependencies (node, ruby, etc.) are available

    "Connection refused" in browser
        1. Check if fireup is running: fireup setup status
        2. Check if port forwarding is set up: fireup ports install
        3. Verify DNS: ping myapp.test (should resolve to 127.0.0.1)

    HTTPS not working
        1. Run: fireup cert install
        2. Restart your browser completely (quit and reopen)
        3. Check certificate status: fireup cert status

    Changes to config not taking effect
        fireup watches config files and reloads automatically.
        If not working, restart the app: fireup restart <app>

    Environment not loading (rbenv, nvm, etc.)
        fireup runs commands in a login shell. Ensure your shell config
        (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc) sets up your environment correctly.

    Rails PID file conflicts
        fireup automatically removes stale tmp/pids/server.pid files
        before starting Rails apps.

TAILSCALE SERVE (REMOTE ACCESS)
    fireup supports Tailscale Serve for accessing your local services
    from other devices on your Tailnet (e.g., your phone).

    SETUP
        1. Install Tailscale and connect to your tailnet
        2. Expose fireup via Tailscale Serve:
               tailscale serve http://127.0.0.1:9280

        3. Access from any device on your tailnet:
               https://<machine-name>.<tailnet>.ts.net/<app-or-service>/

    URL FORMAT
        For simple apps:
            https://macbook.tailnet.ts.net/blog/
            https://macbook.tailnet.ts.net/blog/posts/123

        For multi-service apps, use the service-app format:
            https://macbook.tailnet.ts.net/api-myapp/
            https://macbook.tailnet.ts.net/web-myapp/

        The path prefix is stripped before routing to your service.

    EXAMPLES
        # Expose fireup (run on your laptop)
        tailscale serve http://127.0.0.1:9280

        # From your phone, access the api service of focustrack:
        https://macbook-pro.tail094a69.ts.net/api-focustrack/health

        # Access a simple app:
        https://macbook-pro.tail094a69.ts.net/blog/

    HOW IT WORKS
        When fireup receives a request from a *.ts.net host:
        1. It extracts the app/service name from the first path segment
        2. For "service-app" patterns (e.g., api-myapp), routes to that service
        3. For simple names (e.g., blog), it routes to the app
        4. The path prefix is stripped before forwarding

    INTERSTITIAL PAGES
        When a service is starting, fireup shows an interstitial page that
        polls for status. This works correctly over Tailscale - the page polls
        the same Tailscale URL rather than the local .test domain.

    RESERVED PATH PREFIXES
        The following path prefixes are reserved and cannot be used as app names
        when accessed via Tailscale:

            /api/     - Dashboard API endpoints

        If you have an app named "api", access it via the full service format
        (e.g., /api-myapp/) or rename it.

    STOPPING TAILSCALE SERVE
        tailscale serve reset    # Remove all serve configurations
        tailscale serve status   # View current configuration
